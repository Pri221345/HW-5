    "While solving the above probability, we get to know  that as the number of days went up, the odds tend to stay the same. Even after a long time, 10,000 days case, the chances  in each state get closeby to certain values. Here,in this case, the chances after 10,000 days are very close to the chances after 15 days. It represents that the distribution reached a stable state. We received information that as the number of steps goes up, the probability values get closer together. Where, if the number of trials is low, the model supposed to give too high of odds for rest and sweeties. Hence, as the number of trials goes up, the activities after 10,000 days  settle on 13.76% for rest, 23.85% for sweets, and 62.39% for exercises."
